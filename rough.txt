VARIABLES------------------------------

by using the var keyword we can redeclare the variable and re assign value with same
by using the let keyword we cant redeclare the variable with same name but we can re assign the value
by using the const variable we cant redeclare variable and we cant reassign the value

OBJECTS--------------------------------
to create an object we use  { } and give instructions


#Deep Copy:-deep copy will be effected where shallow copy will not be effected


Operatores----------------------------
+ addition
- Subtration
* multiplication
= equal
== compare the values
===  strictly compare the datatypes
!= (or) !==  not equal to
++ incrementation
-- decrementation
>=== greater then
<=== less then

Logical Operatores:

&& Logical AND checks one
& logical AND checks all
if we are using && if any condition fails then it will not check rest and it will exit 

|| logical OR
| logical OR  just like &

! logical NOT  if this values is not there then it will comes in loop

Data Types:
Number
String
Boolean
Object datatypes
array


if we want to get to know the data type the we can use the "typeof" operator

ARRAYS----------------------------
arrays is also  variable which can hold more then one value
ex:-const number =  [1,2,3,4,5,6]
array  can hold multiple values and we can access those values by refering the index position
console.log(arr[position])
* ---Length Method---
if we want to know the length of array we can use this method
console.log(arr.length)
*---Push Method--
if we want to insert the vue into the last index position we can use push method
arr.push(value)
*---pop Method---
if we want to remove the last index position of array we can use the pop method
arr.pop()
*---Unshift Method---
if we want to add element  into first index position of array we can use "Unshift method "
arr.unshift(value)
*---shift method---
if we want to remove the first element from the array we can use the shift method
arr.shift()
*---concat method---
if we want to combine two single arrays to a single array we can use the contact method
*---for ea(ch  method---
if we get multipleof array inside the array based on the satisfyed condition we can able to delete/ add particcular indx position
*---for method ---
whenever  we want to use the async and await keyword then we can use below method
for(let number of arr){
console.log(numer);
}
*---Map Method---
map method returns new array after performing  function on each element of the array and it does 
*--- Index of method---)
by using indexof method we can find the particular element of the index value
*---Find Method---
if we want to find the particular matched element inside the array of element we use find method
*---includesofMethod---
number.includes(4);
*---sort Method---
by using sort method we can able to arrange the numbers by asending or descending order
*---split method---
if we want to convert the string into array of elements then we can use split method

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#---Functions---
a function is A block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
by using functions we can reuse the functions
when we pass the value into function is calling is called aurgument
when we pass into function we call it as parameter
*---annonymous function---
the function without name is called the annonymous function
*---firstClass Function---
it is a kind of ability to pass as a aurgument into a function
*---nodejs---
=>node js is a open source cross platform runtime environment
=>nodejs allows you to run javascript on the server satisfyed
=>by default nidejs will run in the asyncronus manner
*--set timeout function---
if we want to call the function particular time we can use set time out function
*---set intervel---
if we want to call the function multiple time we can use set intervel
--------------------------------------------------------------------
###'await' expressions are only allowed within async functions and at the top levels of modules.###
if we want to execute the code in synchronus format async keyword
---------------------HTTP METHOD-----------------------------------
POST METHOD:- when we want to insert any data in database we use post method
GET METHOD:-if we want to recive any data from database  we use get method
PUT METHOD:- if we want to update mutiple feilds then we can use put method
PATCH METHOD:- if we want to update one or two feilds we use patch method 
DELETE METHOD:- if we want to delete any data then we can use delete method
Git commands:-
if we want to know the current branch then we cn use the command "git branch"
if we want to know the changes in the current branch then "git status"
if we want to ommit the required files then we can use the "git add (filepath)"
if we want to commit the code in to the branch then we can use the "git commit -m "Random message" "
if we want to push the code into the branch then we can use "git push"ok

Event loop
event loop allows node js to perform nonblocking input/ output/operations even if it is single thread data
nodejs runs on a single threaded but it can take multiple request at a time and whatever the request gets completed those things returned paralally
when we start the nodejs project it intializes the event loop


Event Loop diagram
timers (Ex:- Set time out functions)
pending callbacks (Ex;- IPO operations)
idle (Ex:- DataBase Connection)
polls  (Ex:- I/O events)
checks (Ex;- set immediate functions)
closed callbacks   (Ex:- event emitters , socket.on)

Evet loop executes the task from the callstack whenever the callstack is empty then only it will take the task from the event cube
